# translator (selenium automation)
Translate English from doc on Google Drive
It is use 3 kinds of translators but not use API for each translators.
Using the selenium module to translate, so it's very slow.
The multi-translation site is url below.
https://translators.to/

It use the google doc API.
https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/overview

In my case, some text translate English to Korean, and then added on same document file.
The samples are as follows.

1</br>
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,590</br>
Hello everyone this is kiuk</br>
google: 안녕하세요 여러분 kiuk입니다</br>
papago: 안녕하세요 여러분 키욱입니다.</br>
kakao: 안녕하세요, 여러분 여기는 기욱입니다</br>

In multi-translation site, there are so many translators.
But I think  English to Korean only 3 kinds of translators is good, and especially papago more good.
